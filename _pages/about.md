I'm currently a PhD student working with [Luke Chang](http://lukejchang.com/) in the [COSAN lab](http://cosanlab.com/) at Dartmouth College. My research is primarily centered around neural reward responses to naturalistic stimuli (e.g., food commercials) and how these signals promote appetitive behaviors (e.g., overeating).

Prior to grad school, I worked as a [post-baccalaureate IRTA](https://www.training.nih.gov/programs/postbac_irta) in the NIH's [Laboratory of Brain and Cognition](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/labs-at-nimh/research-areas/clinics-and-labs/lbc/index.shtml) with [Alex Martin](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/labs-at-nimh/principal-investigators/alex-martin.shtml). At the NIH, I worked with [Kyle Simmons](http://www.laureateinstitute.org/kyle-simmons.html) on a large-scale obesity study using fMRI to investigate neural correlates of food reward and gustation.

As an undergraduate at Penn State I dabbled in the labs of [Terri Vescio](http://psych.la.psu.edu/directory/tkv1), [Peter Arnett](http://www.neuropsychologypsu.com/arnettlabhome/), and [William Ray](http://psych.la.psu.edu/directory/wjr). I also spend some time as a research intern at WVU where I worked with [James Lewis](http://neuroscience.wvu.edu/people/faculty/lewis) investigating human vocalization processing in the brain.
