I'm currently a Dartmouth College PhD student in the [COSAN lab](http://cosanlab.com/) working with [Luke Chang](http://lukejchang.com/) as well as with [Todd Heatherton](https://www.dartmouth.edu/~heath/). My research is primarily centered around neural responses to naturalistic stimuli (e.g., food commercials) and how these signals promote appetitive behaviors (e.g., overeating). 

I recently spend some time working with [Morten Kringelbach](https://www.psych.ox.ac.uk/team/mlk) in the [Hedonia Lab](http://hedonia.kringelbach.org/) in Aarhus, Denmark & Oxford, UK, where I learned techniques used to uncover patterns of neural oscillations and state transitions driven by alterations in consciousness (e.g., sleep, psychedelics).

Prior to grad school, I worked as a [post-baccalaureate IRTA](https://www.training.nih.gov/programs/postbac_irta) in the NIH's [Laboratory of Brain and Cognition](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/labs-at-nimh/research-areas/clinics-and-labs/lbc/index.shtml) with [Alex Martin](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/labs-at-nimh/principal-investigators/alex-martin.shtml). At the NIH, I worked with [Kyle Simmons](http://www.laureateinstitute.org/kyle-simmons.html) on a large-scale obesity study using fMRI to investigate neural correlates of food reward and gustation.

As an undergraduate at Penn State I dabbled in the labs of [Terri Vescio](http://psych.la.psu.edu/directory/tkv1), [Peter Arnett](http://www.neuropsychologypsu.com/arnettlabhome/), and [William Ray](http://psych.la.psu.edu/directory/wjr). I also spend a summer at WVU where I worked with [James Lewis](http://neuroscience.wvu.edu/people/faculty/lewis) investigating human vocalization processing in the brain.
