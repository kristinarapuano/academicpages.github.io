I'm <b>currently</b> a postdoc in the [FAB lab](http://fablab.yale.edu/) working with the FABulous [BJ Casey](https://psychology.yale.edu/people/bj-casey). Before this, I completed my PhD at Dartmouth College with [Luke Chang](http://lukejchang.com/) in the [COSAN lab](http://cosanlab.com/). 

I'm <b>interested in</b> understanding the brain's reward system, including how the brain contructs hedonic experience and how this system drives potentially risky health behaviors. Read more about my research [here](https://kristinarapuano.github.io/research/).

I'm also a vocal <b>advocate</b> for increasing visibility of women in STEM. I plan to include more on this topic in [blog-form](https://kristinarapuano.github.io/year-archive/), but for now you can follow me [twitter](https://twitter.com/kristinarapuano).
