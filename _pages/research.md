<!-- <i>What makes the taste of ice cream so enjoyable? What drives people to engage in potentially risky behaviors?</i> -->

<!-- I'm interested in how people perceive reward cues in their environments, and how individual differences in these responses promote differences in appetitive behaviors. 

<!-- More specifically, I'm interested in (1) how the brain processes information about reward, including the computation of affective subjective experience (i.e., pleasure); (2) how the brain uses this information to drive real-world appetitive behaviors -->
