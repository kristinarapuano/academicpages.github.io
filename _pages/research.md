<!-- <b>Obesity, substance abuse, addiction.</b> What do these things have in common? An imbalance in the motivation to engage in a behavior (eating/smoking/drinking/drugs) relative to <i>not</i> engaging in that behavior.-->

How does the brain respond to reward cues in the environment, and why are some individuals more susceptible to these cues than others? 

My work leverages neural responses to real-world stimuli (e.g., food advertisements) in order to understand how these environmental cues might influence real-world outcomes (e.g., obesity; Rapuano et al., 2015) or interact with genetic risk [Rapuano et al., 2016](https://kristinarapuano.github.io/files/Rapuano_2016_PNAS.pdf).

In addition to this, I have a strong interest in understanding the dynamics of the brain on a variety of timescales. For example, how does affective information influence brain state transitions over time, and how do these states motivate behavior? How do brain dynamics influence cognition and behavior on shorter timescales (e.g., moment-to-moment feelings or decisions), as well as on longer timescales (e.g., over the course of the lifespan)?

<!-- Finally, I have a pet-interest in studies that have direct applications to social justice and public policy.  -->
