Why are some individuals more susceptible to engage in risky health behaviors? Relative to adults, adolescents are more prone to engage in potentially risky behaviors, but why are some more likely to overeat, abuse alcohol, or become addicted to substances?

My previous work explored environmental and genetic influences on adolescent health-risk outcomes by leveraging pervasive exposure to advertisements. In using naturalistic stimuli like ads, we were able to approximate how these types of real-world cues might contribute to pediatric obesity (Rapuano et al., 2015), interact with genetic risk for obesity [Rapuano et al., 2016](https://kristinarapuano.github.io/files/Rapuano_2016_PNAS.pdf), or align individuals with a common goal (e.g., underage drinking).

Currently, I'm interested in extending this work to examine the contribution of neurodevelopment on health-risk behaviors and outcomes. How might the trajectories of interconnected brain regions differentially motivate adolescents to use or abuse illicit substances?
